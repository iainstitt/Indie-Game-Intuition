# Insight_project
Through September and October 2017 I participated in the Insight Data Science Fellows program in New York City. Insight is a program that helps people transition from academia to careers in the data science industry. One of the cornerstones of the program is the Insight Data Science project, a 3 week endeavor completed using Python machine learning libraries and SQL. In this repository, you can find the code I wrote for my Insight project entitled “Indie game intuition”. 

Each script is commented to document the steps I took to first obtain, analyze, and then model Steam user data. The code is designed to go through in series, starting with the first script "01_Generate_list_of_users.ipynb"

A detailed write up of this project can be found on my personal website here: https://www.iainstitt.net/insight-project
