# Insight_project
Through September and October 2017 I participated in the Insight Data Science Fellows program in New York City. Insight is a program that helps people transition from academia to careers in the data science industry. One of the cornerstones of the program is the Insight Data Science project, a 3 week endeavor completed using Python machine learning libraries and SQL. Below, you can find the code I wrote for my Insight project entitled “Indie game intuition”.
